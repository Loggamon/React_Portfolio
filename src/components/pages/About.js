      <p>Hi!</p>
      <p>
        My name Is Logan Monson; I'm a Seattle-based barista that has decided to
        step into the world of coding!
      </p>
      <p>
        I started learning about fullstack development in 2022, and have created
        applications that have used Mongo, MySQL, and React; as well as
        designing Progressive Web Applications and express-driven programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love to write music, play videogames, and play tabletop games with my
        friends!
